The steps which were taken to achieve this handling prevent it from
being reliably used for other machine types

Parameters:

* `-a, --appliances`: The hostname(s), ip addresse(s), environment name(s)
or alias(es) of the appliances you would like to affect. For details
on configuring environments please see the comments in
`environments.conf` located in `$MAST_HOME/etc/default`. For details
on configuring aliases please see the comments in `hosts.conf` located
in `$MAST_HOME/etc/default`.
* `-c, --credentials`: The credentials to use for authenticating to the
appliances. Should be either one set to use for all appliances
or one set for each appliance. Credentials should be in the form
`username:password` and should be provided in a space-seperated list
if multiple are provided. If you would prefer to not use plain-text
passwords, you can use the output of `$ mast-system xor <username:password>`.
* `-d, --domain`: The domain to log into
* `-i, --input-file`: If provided, it should point to a text file which
contains cli commands (one-per-line) which will be executed in order on
each appliance
* `-t, --timeout`: The timeout in seconds to wait for a response from
an appliance for any single request. __NOTE__ Program execution may
halt if a timeout is reached.
